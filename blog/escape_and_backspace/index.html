<p>I have fairly long fingers. They may grow even longer one day, I’m not even 18
yet.
However, I have one small, actually pretty big problem: my small finger can’t
reach backspace, the most frequently used key!</p>
<p>And there’s another problem: I use Vim and I can’t reach the escape key with my
small finger!</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>Inspired by the Colemak layout that I already use on all my touch-screen enabled
devices (I will learn it one day, don’t worry), I mapped backspace to the caps
lock key.</p>
<p>But what about escape?</p>
<p>Luckily, there’s another key on this big keyboard that I don’t use at all: the
right alt key, also called “AltGr”. So I mapped escape to it.</p>
<h3 id="how-">How?</h3>
<p>I use a UNIX-like operating system called “Linux”. You may have heard about it.</p>
<p>Some UNIX-like OS-es come with a tool called <code>xmodmap</code> in their repositories. It
modifies keymaps.</p>
<p>That sounds like the perfect tool to map these keys! And it really is, with a
catch: changes are available only when using the X window system.</p>
<p>Here’s my <code>.xmodmaprc</code>:</p>
<pre><code>! <span class="hljs-built_in">remove</span> caps
clear lock
<span class="hljs-built_in">remove</span> Lock = Caps_Lock
<span class="hljs-built_in">remove</span> Shift = Caps_Lock

keysym Alt_R = Escape

! <span class="hljs-keyword">make</span> caps backspace
keysym Caps_Lock = BackSpace
</code></pre><p>And that’s it! Now I have to get used to it…</p>
