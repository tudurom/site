        <h3>Story</h3>

<p>I have fairly long fingers. They may grow even longer one day, I&rsquo;m not even 18
yet.
However, I have one small, actually pretty big problem: my small finger can&rsquo;t
reach backspace, the most frequently used key!</p>

<p>And there&rsquo;s another problem: I use Vim and I can&rsquo;t reach the escape key with my
small finger!</p>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<p>Inspired by the Colemak layout that I already use on all my touch-screen enabled
devices (I will learn it one day, don&rsquo;t worry), I mapped backspace to the caps
lock key.</p>

<p>But what about escape?</p>

<p>Luckily, there&rsquo;s another key on this big keyboard that I don&rsquo;t use at all: the
right alt key, also called &ldquo;AltGr&rdquo;. So I mapped escape to it.</p>

<h3>How?</h3>

<p>I use a UNIX-like operating system called &ldquo;Linux&rdquo;. You may have heard about it.</p>

<p>Some UNIX-like OS-es come with a tool called <code>xmodmap</code> in their repositories. It
modifies keymaps.</p>

<p>That sounds like the perfect tool to map these keys! And it really is, with a
catch: changes are available only when using the X window system.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my <code>.xmodmaprc</code>:</p>

<pre><code>! remove caps
clear lock
remove Lock = Caps_Lock
remove Shift = Caps_Lock

keysym Alt_R = Escape

! make caps backspace
keysym Caps_Lock = BackSpace
</code></pre>

<p>And that&rsquo;s it! Now I have to get used to it&hellip;</p>
