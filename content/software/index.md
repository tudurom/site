This is a list of software projects worth mentioning made by me, and their coresponding web pages.

Most listed programs run only on UNIX-like platforms.

### Desktop workflow

Programs that together can be used to make a lightweight desktop environment.

* [windowchef](windowchef/) - A lightweight stacking window manager for X11;
* [ruler](https://github.com/tudurom/ruler) - Window rule daemon. Executes user-defined commands when windows with certain properties are spawned/mapped;
* [disputils](https://github.com/tudurom/disputils) - Display information querying utilities. List displays, their size and such;
