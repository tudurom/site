-------

I go by the handle "tudurom" or "tudorr" on some sites.

This website is a collection of my thoughts and work and I hope people can learn
from it. I also have a [blog](/blog/).
I usually make my projects open-source. They are public on
[The Code Pantry](https://git.tudorr.ro/),
[GitHub](https://github.com/tudurom/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/tudorr/), [Sourcehut](https://sr.ht/~tudor/).

### Online

* [PGP public key](/pgp.pub)
* [SSH public key](/ssh.pub)
* <span id="email"><noscript>email: Enable javascript to see it, or grab a git
	repo of mine and look through `git log`.</noscript></span>
* [GitHub](https://github.com/tudurom)

<script>
document.getElementById('email').innerHTML =
`<a href="javascript:;" class="fakelink" onclick="this.innerHTML = atob('dHVkb3JAdHVkb3JyLnJv')">email</a>
`
</script>

### Software I made

More details [here](/software/).

* [cardboard](https://gitlab.com/cardboardwm/cardboard) - scrollable tiling Wayland compositor;
* [windowchef](https://github.com/tudurom/windowchef/) - scriptable stacking X11 window manager;
* [rwsh](https://git.sr.ht/~tudor/rwsh) - a new, modern shell, that doubles as a
	text processor. More of an experiment, incomplete;
* [ruler](https://github.com/tudurom/ruler/) - window rule daemon for X11;
* [dotfiles](https://github.com/tudurom/dotfiles/) - managed with [`home-manager`](https://github.com/rycee/home-manager) and Nix.
