Software
--------

This is a list of software projects made by me and their coresponding web pages.

Most listed programs run only on UNIX-like platforms.

### Desktop workflow

Programs that together can be used to make a lightweight desktop environment.

* [windowchef](windowchef/) - A lightweight stacking window manager for X11.
* [ruler](https://github.com/tudurom/ruler) - Window rule daemon. Executes user-defined commands when windows with certain properties are spawned/mapped.
* [disputils](https://github.com/tudurom/disputils) - Display information querying utilities. List displays, their size and such.
* [dotfiles](https://github.com/tudurom/dotfiles) - The glue

### Real stuff

* [XMC](https://github.com/xmc-dev) - XMC Manages Contests. CS contest manager. Work In Progress.

### Telegram bots

* [slashr_bot](https://github.com/tudurom/slashr_bot) - Reddit shortlink (`/u/`, `/r/`) bot.
* [mangler_bot](https://t.me/mangler_bot) - Bot that mangles text to make it meme-y.

### Desktop style

Programs that are only for aesthetic purposes.

* [rainbou](https://github.com/tudurom/orator) - Color scheme database and config file generator.
* [startpage](https://github.com/tudurom/startpage) - Smart browser start page that fetches the color scheme from the X Resource Database.

### Web stuff

Web dev.

* [orator](https://github.com/tudurom/orator) - One of my first Go projects. Simple static site generator. I'm still using it to this day to generate this very site. I warn you, the code is horrible.
* [this website](https://github.com/tudurom/) - Self-explanatory.
