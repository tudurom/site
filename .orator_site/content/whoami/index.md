Hey, my name is Tudor and I study computer science at the
["Tudor Vianu" National College of Computer Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tudor_Vianu_National_College_of_Computer_Science)
in [Bucharest, Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucharest). Online I'm known as "tudurom".
My passion and hobby is designing and writing computer programs. I like [the UNIX
philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) because of the way it
encourages programs to cooperate.

This website is a collection of my thoughts and work and I hope people can learn
from this website. I also have a [blog](/blog).

I usually make all my projects open-source. They are public on [this
  site](/git) and [on GitHub](https://github.com/tudurom).
