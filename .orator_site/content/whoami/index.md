Hey, my name is Tudor and I'm online known as "tudurom".
My passion and hobby is designing and writing computer programs. I like [the UNIX
philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) because of the way it
encourages programs to cooperate.

This website is a collection of my thoughts and work and I hope people can learn
from this website. I also have a [blog](/blog).

I usually make all my projects open-source. They are public on
[GitHub](https://github.com/tudurom/).

### I speak in a multitude of languages:

Romanian, C, English, Go, JavaScript, POSIX shell, Ruby\*, French\*

##### \* I speak very rarely in these languages or I'm not very experienced with them

### Online

* [PGP public key](/pgp.pub)
* [SSH public key](/ssh.pub)

### Software I made
