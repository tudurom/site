-------

I go by the handle "tudurom" on some sites (GitHub, reddit).

My passion and hobby is designing and writing computer programs. I like [the UNIX
philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) because of the way it
encourages programs to cooperate.

This website is a collection of my thoughts and work and I hope people can learn
from it. I also have a [blog](/blog).
I usually make my projects open-source. They are public on
[GitHub](https://github.com/tudurom/).

### I speak in a multitude of languages:

Romanian, C, English, Go, JavaScript, POSIX shell, \*CSS3, HTML5, \*Ruby

##### \* I speak very rarely in these languages or I'm not very experienced with them

### Online

* [PGP public key](/pgp.pub)
* [SSH public key](/ssh.pub)
* <span id="email"><noscript>email: Enable javascript to see it, or grab a git
	repo of mine and look through `git log`.</noscript></span>
* [GitHub](https://github.com/tudurom)

<script>
document.getElementById('email').innerHTML =
`<span class="fakelink" onclick="this.innerHTML = atob('dHVkb3JAdHVkb3JyLnJv')">email</span>
`
</script>

### Software I made

* [windowchef](https://github.com/tudurom/windowchef/) - scriptable stacking window manager.
* [rwsh](https://git.sr.ht/~tudor/rwsh) - a new, modern shell, that doubles as a
	text processor. Work in progress.
* [orator](https://github.com/tudurom/orator/) - static site generator (used to build this site).
* [albumify](https://github.com/gnotclub/albumify-next/) - image album generator.
* [ruler](https://github.com/tudurom/ruler/) - window rule daemon.
* [rainbou](https://github.com/tudurom/rainbou/) - color scheme config file generator.
* [dotfiles](https://github.com/tudurom/dotfiles/) - files of the dots.
