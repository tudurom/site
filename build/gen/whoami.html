<p>Hey, my name is Tudor and I study computer science at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tudor_Vianu_National_College_of_Computer_Science">National College of Computer Science “Tudor Vianu”</a> in Bucharest, Romania. Online I’m known as “tudurom”. My
passion and hobby is designing and writing computer programs. I like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">the UNIX
philosophy</a> because of the way it
encourages programs to cooperate.</p>
<p>This website is a collection of my thoughts and work and I hope people can learn
from this website. I also have a <a href="/blog">blog</a>.</p>
<p>I usually make all my projects open-source. They are public on <a href="/git">this
  site</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tudurom">on GitHub</a>.</p>
