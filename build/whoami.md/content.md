Hey, my name is Tudor and I study computer science at the [National College of Computer Science "Tudor Vianu"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tudor_Vianu_National_College_of_Computer_Science) in Bucharest, Romania. Online I'm known as "tudurom". My
passion and hobby is designing and writing computer programs. I like [the UNIX
philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) because of the way it
encourages programs to cooperate.

This website is a collection of my thoughts and work and I hope people can learn
from this website. I also have a [blog](/blog).

I usually make all my projects open-source. They are public on [this
  site](/git) and [on GitHub](https://github.com/tudurom).

### I speak in a multitude of languages:

Romanian, C, English, Go, JavaScript, POSIX shell, Ruby\*, Java, French\*

##### \* I speak very rarely in these languages or I'm not very experienced with them
