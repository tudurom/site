I'm Tudor. People often call me "tudu". Online I'm known as "tudurom". My
passion is designing and writing computer programs. I like [the UNIX
philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy). I learn by
doing. Very chill person. I like simplicity.

This website is a collection of my thoughts and work and I hope people can learn
from this website. I also have a [blog](/blog).

### I speak in a multitude of languages:

Romanian, C, Go, JavaScript, POSIX shell, Ruby\*, English, Java\*, French

##### * I speak very rarely in those languages or I'm not very experienced with them

#### Visit Romania, it's a very beautiful country!
